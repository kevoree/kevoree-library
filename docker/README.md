## Getting started
#### Requirements
You will need [**Docker**](http://docs.docker.io/installation/) on the host machine in order to use Kevoree's `DockerNode`  

> __/!\__ For `push` actions you will have to give your Docker registry username/password as Kevoree does not yet support password hiding in its model
